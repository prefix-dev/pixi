# This project shows that extras are properly checked by the satisfiability algorithm. The main
# project (this file) depends on two pypi projects without any extras. The project "has-extras" has
# an extra called "pinject" which controls whether it depends on pinject or not. The pyproject
# "use-with-extras" also depends on "has-extras" but with the "pinject" extra enabled. Because of
# this, the "pinject" package should be part of the solution.
