# This file defines the wheels that are used to test common wheels and adding them using pixi
# Add the top-level wheels, for where you want a simple `name` = `version` mapping
# Add more complex mappings using the [[name]] table, where you can specify extras, version, and more
# Or a single [name] for a more complex version
