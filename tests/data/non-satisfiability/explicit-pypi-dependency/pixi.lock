#
# This lock-file should not satisfy the accompanying pixi.toml file.
#
# boltons is requested as a pypi package. The pypi dependency can also be
# satisfied by the conda package that is in the lock-file, but since none of the
# conda packages reference the boltons conda package, it should be dropped in
# favor of the pypi package.
