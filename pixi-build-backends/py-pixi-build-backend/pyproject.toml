# type annotations. See https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/issues/1112 for a discussion on adding
# this capability. We could add a stub file for pixi_build_backend.pixi_build_backend (the PyO3 api), but that
# amounts to duplicating almost all type annotations on our api, as the Python api itself is a
# thin wrapper around the PyO3 api to start with.
