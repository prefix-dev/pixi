# Contributing to Pixi
## Introduction
Thank you for your interest in contributing to Pixi! We value the contributions from our community and look forward to collaborating with you.

## Code of Conduct
Before contributing, please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We expect all our contributors to follow it to ensure a welcoming and inclusive environment.

## Getting Started
**Familiarize yourself with Pixi:** Understand its functionality and codebase.
**Set up your environment:** Ensure you have the necessary tools and dependencies.

## How to Contribute
- **Find an Issue:** Look for open issues or create a new issue to discuss your idea.
- **Fork the Repository:** Make a copy of the repository to your account.
- **Create a Branch:** Create a branch in your fork to work on your changes.
- **Develop and Test:** Implement your changes and make sure they are thoroughly tested.
- **Write Clear Commit Messages:** Make your changes easy to understand.
- **Create a Pull Request:** Submit your changes for review.

> [!TIP]
> Discuss your change in the issue before developing the solution when the design is not predefined.
> This will help speedup the actual pull request review.

## Pull Request Process
- Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards, we use automated tooling for that, try `pixi run lint`.
- Document new code using the Rust docstrings like we do in most places.
- Update the `README.md` or documentation (`docs/`) with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.
- Your pull request will be reviewed by maintainers, who may suggest changes.

## Reporting Bugs
- Use the issue tracker to report bugs.
- Clearly describe the issue, including steps to reproduce the bug.
- Include any relevant logs or error messages.

## Feature Requests
- Use the issue tracker to suggest new features.
- Explain how the feature would be beneficial to the project.

## Questions and Discussions

# Tips while developing on `pixi`

## Pixi is a Pixi project itself, so use a preinstalled `pixi` to run the predefined tasks
```shell
pixi run build-debug # or `pixi run build-release` to build with optimizations
pixi run lint
pixi run test-all-fast
pixi run install # only works on unix systems as on windows you can't overwrite the binary while it's running
```

### Installing the target binaries to a custom location

Use the Pixi task `install-as` which invokes a python script to build the project and copy the executable to a custom location.
```shell
$ pixi run install-as
usage: install.py [-h] [--dest DEST] name

Build pixi and copy the executable to ~/.pixi/bin or a custom destination

positional arguments:
  name                  Name of the executable (e.g. pixid)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --dest DEST           Destination directory for the executable, default: $PIXI_HOME/bin (or ~/.pixi/bin if $PIXI_HOME isn't set)
```

## Get your code ready for a PR
We use [`leftook`](https://lefthook.dev/) to run all the formatters and linters that we use.
You can run `pixi run pre-commit-install` to automatically run the formatters and linters before you commit.
This also installs a pre-push hook which runs `cargo clippy` â€”
use `pixi run pre-commit-install-minimal` instead to opt out of this hook.
To run all formatters and linters on all files:

```shell
pixi run lint
```

When you commit your code, please try to come up with a good commit message.
The maintainers (try to) use [conventional-commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
```shell
git add FILES_YOU_CHANGED
# This is the conventional commit convention:
git commit -m "<type>[optional scope]: <description>"
# An example:
git commit -m "feat(exec): add xxx option"
```

## Color decisions in the ui code
We use the `console::style` function to colorize the output of the ui.
```rust
use console::style;
println!("{} {}", style("Hello").green(), style("world").red());
```

To sync the colors of the different parts of the ui, we use the following rules:
- `style("environment").magenta()`: The environment name
- `style("feature").cyan()`: The feature name
- `style("task").blue()`: The task name

These styles are put in the `consts` module or are a `.fancy_display()` on the names. If you want to add a new generic color, please add it there.


## Comment for Breaking Change
If you have a work-around for a potential breaking change, please add a comment in the code where you think the breaking change will happen. And what needs to be done when we **actually** want to break it. Use `BREAK:` in the comment to denote this.

For example:
```rust
// an enum to sort by size or name
#[derive(clap::ValueEnum, Clone, Debug, Serialize)]
pub enum SortBy {
    Size,
    Name,
    // BREAK: remove the alias
    #[value(alias = "type")]
    Kind,
}
```

## Tests

To run all tests, use:
```bash
pixi run test
```
But if you have modified recipe data under the tests/data/channels directory, you need to update the test channel before running tests:
```bash
pixi run update-test-channel <channel_name>
```
> [!NOTE]
> This task currently only works on unix systems. If you are on Windows, it is recommended to use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

For example, if you modified data for dummy_channel_1:
```bash
pixi run update-test-channel dummy_channel_1
```
After updating the test channel, run the tests again:
```
pixi run test
```

## CLI documentation
The CLI reference is automatically generated from the code documentation of CLI commands under `src/cli`.

If you need to update this documentation, be sure to edit the docs under `src/cli`
instead of modifying the automatically generated Markdown files under `docs/reference/cli`.

Then, you can run `pixi run generate-cli-docs` to update the generated files,
and `pixi run -e docs mkdocs serve` to check out the web docs locally.

You must commit the generated files as well as part of your PR.

The `*_extender` files under `docs/reference/cli` are meant as extensions of the autogenerated documentation.
Those are meant to be updated manually.

## Python test snapshots

Snapshots can be included in Python tests using `inline-snapshot`, following the pattern in
https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/blob/main/tests/integration_python/test_import.py.

1. To add a new snapshot, you first write `assert value == snapshot()`, where `value` is the
string you are testing.
2. You can then run your tests with `pixi run test-specific-test your_test_name`. The test should
error (this is expected), but also create a snapshot inline (inside the parentheses which follow
`snapshot`), unless the test fails for another reason before hitting the `snapshot()` line.
If the test fails for another reason, fix that reason and run the tests again.
3. Running tests in the future will prompt you whenever actual values do not match the snapshots.
If you want to fix all snapshots and review the diff afterwards, you can use `pixi run snapshot-update your_test_name`.
4. You may wish to redact parts of snapshots. This will be necessary when values are dependent on
the machine running the tests, e.g. manifests created with `pixi init`. This can be done using
`dirty-equals`: see documentation at https://15r10nk.github.io/inline-snapshot/0.23/eq_snapshot/#dirty-equals
and examples in https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/blob/main/tests/integration_python/test_import.py.
