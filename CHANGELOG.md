## [0.8.0] - 2023-11-27

### Highlights
* 🎉🐍`[pypi-dependencies]` ALPHA RELEASE🐍🎉, you can now add PyPI dependencies to your pixi project.
* UX of `pixi run` has been improved with better errors and showing what task is run.

> [!NOTE]
> `[pypi-dependencies]` support is still incomplete, missing functionality is listed here: https://github.com/orgs/prefix-dev/projects/6.
> Our intent is not to have 100% feature parity with `pip`, our goal is that you only need `pixi` for both conda and pypi packages alike.

Platform specific dependencies using `[target.linux-64.dependencies]` instead of `[dependencies]` in the `pixi.toml`

Lots and lots of fixes and improvements to make it easier for this user, where bumping to the new version of [`rattler`](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler/releases/tag/v0.4.0)
