[Full commit history](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/compare/v0.14.0..v0.15.0)

## [0.14.0] - 2024-02-15

### ✨ Highlights
Now, `solve-groups` can be used in `[environments]` to ensure dependency alignment across different environments without simultaneous installation.
This feature is particularly beneficial for managing identical dependencies in `test` and `production` environments.
Example configuration:

```toml
[environments]
test = { features = ["prod", "test"], solve-groups = ["group1"] }
prod = { features = ["prod"], solve-groups = ["group1"] }
```
This setup simplifies managing dependencies that must be consistent across `test` and `production`.
