## [0.0.6] - 2023-06-30

### Highlights
Improving the reliability is important to us, so we added an integration testing framework, we can now test as close as possible to the CLI level using `cargo`.

### Details

#### Added
- An integration test harness, to test as close as possible to the user experience but in rust. ([#138](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/pull/138), [#140](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/pull/140), [#156](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/pull/156))
- Add different levels of dependencies in preparation for `pixi build`, allowing `host-` and `build-` `dependencies` ([#149](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/pull/149))

#### Fixed
- Use correct folder name on pixi init ([#144](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/pull/144))
- Fix windows cli installer ([#152](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/pull/152))
- Fix global install path variable ([#147](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/pull/147))
- Fix macOS binary notarization ([#153](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/pull/153))

## [0.0.5] - 2023-06-26

Fixing Windows installer build in CI. ([#145](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/pull/145))

## [0.0.4] - 2023-06-26

### Highlights

A new command, `auth` which can be used to authenticate the host of the package channels.
A new command, `shell` which can be used to start a shell in the pixi environment of a project.
A refactor of the `install` command which is changed to `global install` and the `install` command now installs a pixi project if you run it in the directory.
Platform specific dependencies using `[target.linux-64.dependencies]` instead of `[dependencies]` in the `pixi.toml`

Lots and lots of fixes and improvements to make it easier for this user, where bumping to the new version of [`rattler`](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler/releases/tag/v0.4.0)
helped a lot.

### Details

#### Added

- Platform specific dependencies and helpful error reporting on `pixi.toml` issues([#111](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/pull/111))
- Windows installer, which is very useful for users that want to start using pixi on windows. ([#114](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/pull/114))
- `shell` command to use the pixi environment without `pixi run`. ([#116](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/pull/116))
- Verbosity options using `-v, -vv, -vvv` ([#118](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/pull/118))
- `auth` command to be able to login or logout of a host like `repo.prefix.dev` if you're using private channels. ([#120](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/pull/120))
- New examples: CPP sdl: [#121](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/pull/121), Opencv camera calibration [#125](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/pull/125)
- Apple binary signing and notarization. ([#137](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/pull/137))
