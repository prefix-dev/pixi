## Description

Re-install an environment, both updating the lockfile and re-installing the environment.

This command reinstalls an environment, if the lockfile is not up-to-date it will be updated. If packages are specified, only those packages will be reinstalled. Otherwise the whole environment will be reinstalled.

`pixi reinstall` only re-installs one environment at a time, if you have multiple environments you can select the right one with the `--environment` flag. If you don't provide an environment, the `default` environment will be re-installed.

If you want to re-install all environments, you can use the `--all` flag.
