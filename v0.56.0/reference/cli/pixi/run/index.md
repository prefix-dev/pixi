## Description

Runs task in the pixi environment.

This command is used to run tasks in the pixi environment. It will activate the environment and run the task in the environment. It is using the deno_task_shell to run the task.

`pixi run` will also update the lockfile and install the environment if it is required.

## Examples

```shell
pixi run python
pixi run cowpy "Hey pixi user"
pixi run --manifest-path ~/myworkspace/pixi.toml python
pixi run --frozen python
pixi run --locked python
# If you have specified a custom task in the pixi.toml you can run it with run as well
pixi run build
# Extra arguments will be passed to the tasks command.
pixi run task argument1 argument2
# Skip dependencies of the task
pixi run --skip-deps task
# Run in dry-run mode to see the commands that would be run
pixi run --dry-run task
# If you have multiple environments you can select the right one with the --environment flag.
pixi run --environment cuda python
# THIS DOESN'T WORK ON WINDOWS
# If you want to run a command in a clean environment you can use the --clean-env flag.
# The PATH should only contain the pixi environment here.
pixi run --clean-env "echo \$PATH"

```

## Notes

Info

In `pixi` the [`deno_task_shell`](https://deno.land/manual@v1.35.0/tools/task_runner#task-runner) is the underlying runner of the run command. Checkout their [documentation](https://deno.land/manual@v1.35.0/tools/task_runner#task-runner) for the syntax and available commands. This is done so that the run commands can be run across all platforms.

Cross environment tasks

If you're using the `depends-on` feature of the `tasks`, the tasks will be run in the order you specified them. The `depends-on` can be used cross environment, e.g. you have this `pixi.toml`:

pixi.toml

```toml
[tasks]
start = { cmd = "python start.py", depends-on = ["build"] }
[feature.build.tasks]
build = "cargo build"
[feature.build.dependencies]
rust = ">=1.74"
[environments]
build = ["build"]

```

Then you're able to run the `build` from the `build` environment and `start` from the default environment. By only calling:

```shell
pixi run start

```
