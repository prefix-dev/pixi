This directory contains the same structure as the autogenerated cli documentation.

In all the autogenerated files, there are `snippets` injected like `description` and `example`.

If you put a file with the same file name and path as the autogenerated companion file, the `snippets` will be injected into the file.

For example, `docs/autogenerated/pixi.md` is the autogenerated file and `docs/reference/cli/pixi.md` is the injecting file.

Snipped documentation can be found here: https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/snippets/
