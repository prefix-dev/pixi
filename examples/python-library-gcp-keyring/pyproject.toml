# Introduction:
#
# This is a small example that builds and uploads a `.whl` to a custom pypi registry
# If you want to upload to PyPI just replace the `--repository-url`
# To use with GCP, make sure you've run a `gcloud auth`
#
# Install keyring and keyrings.google-artifactregistry-auth globally:
# `pixi global install keyring --with keyrings.google-artifactregistry-auth`
#
# Using the custom registry:
#
# To use the custom GCP registry, unfortunately you have to have keyring installed globally
# Because `uv` which we use for PyPI resolution uses a subprocess to call `keyring`
# Also you need to add `oauth2accesstoken@` to the url e.g.
# `https://oauth2token@europe-west4-python.pkg.dev/test-artifact-registry-423208/test/`
#
# Example of a feature that uses this:
#
# [feature.lib.pypi-options]
# index-url = "https://oauth2accesstoken@europe-west4-python.pkg.dev/test-artifact-registry-423208/test/"
#
# [feature.lib.pypi-dependencies]
# python-library-gcp-keyring = { version = "==0.1.0" }
#
# To Install:
# Use `pixi install --pypi-keyring-provider subprocess` or configure in global configuration
