# Rerun examples
This directory contains a few examples. The `lidar` and `nuscenes_dataset` directories contain examples of how to log data with Rerun, while the `rerun_example` directory contains an examples directly copied in from the rerun repository.
All credits for the visualizations go to the Rerun team!

The purpose of these examples is to demonstrate how you can use Rerun with Pixi.


## Give it a go:

```shell
# Simple example of a graph visualization of the pixi.lock
pixi run start
# Example of lidar data from a driving car
pixi run lidar
# Example of a nuscenes dataset visualization
pixi run nuscenes_dataset
```
