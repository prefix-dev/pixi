# ReadTheDocs: Override Build

> [!WARNING]
> The full build override feature is still in _beta_. See the ReadTheDocs
> [documentation][override] for more.

This example shows how to [override] a [ReadTheDocs] `mkdocs` build by using
`pixi` in [build.commands].

> [!NOTE]
>
> For a more involved `sphinx` build, see the [`readthedocs-extend`][extend] example.
