# The solve-group mixes the dependencies of all features in the group and solves them together.
# Both environments should have at most python 3.10, even though `min-py38` environment only
# specifies a lower bound.
#
# The environments do not contain any dependencies from the other environments. This means that
# the `min-py38` environment does not contain `pydantic` and the `max-py310` environment does not
# contain `py-rattler`.
