# Pixi: Package Management Made Easy

## Overview

`pixi` is a cross-platform, multi-language package manager and workflow tool built on the foundation of the conda ecosystem. It provides developers with an exceptional experience similar to popular package managers like `cargo` or `yarn`, but for any language.

Developed with ‚ù§Ô∏è at [prefix.dev](https://prefix.dev).
[![Real-time pixi_demo](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/assets/12893423/0fc8f8c8-ac13-4c14-891b-dc613f25475b)](https://asciinema.org/a/636482)

## Highlights

- Supports **multiple languages** including Python, C++, and R using Conda packages. You can find available packages on [prefix.dev](https://prefix.dev).
- Compatible with all major operating systems: Linux, Windows, macOS (including Apple Silicon).
- Always includes an up-to-date **lock file**.
- Provides a clean and simple Cargo-like **command-line interface**.
- Allows you to install tools **per-project** or **system-wide**.
- Entirely written in **Rust** and built on top of the **[rattler](https://github.com/conda/rattler)** library.

## Status

Pixi is ready for production!
We are working hard to keep file-format changes compatible with the previous
versions so that you can rely on Pixi with peace of mind.

Some notable features we envision for upcoming releases are:

- **Build and publish** your project as a Conda package.
- Support for **dependencies from source**.
- More powerful "global installation" of packages towards a deterministic setup of global packages on multiple machines.

## Installation

`pixi` can be installed on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The provided scripts will automatically download the latest version of `pixi`, extract it, and move the `pixi` binary to `~/.pixi/bin`. If this directory does not exist, the script will create it.

### macOS and Linux

To install Pixi on macOS and Linux, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh
# or with brew
brew install pixi
```

The script will also update your `~/.bashrc` to include `~/.pixi/bin` in your `PATH`, allowing you to invoke the `pixi` command from anywhere.
You might need to restart your terminal or source your shell for the changes to take effect.

Starting with macOS Catalina [zsh is the default login shell and interactive shell](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102360). Therefore, you might want to use `zsh` instead of `bash` in the install command:

```zsh
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | zsh
```

The script will also update your `~/.zshrc` to include `~/.pixi/bin` in your `PATH`, allowing you to invoke the `pixi` command from anywhere.

### Windows

To install Pixi on Windows, open a PowerShell terminal (you may need to run it as an administrator) and run the following command:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm -useb https://pixi.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
```
Changing the [execution policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.4#powershell-execution-policies) allows running a script from the internet.
Check the script you would be running with:
```powershell
powershell -c "irm -useb https://pixi.sh/install.ps1 | more"
```

The script will inform you once the installation is successful and add the `~/.pixi/bin` directory to your `PATH`, which will allow you to run the `pixi` command from any location.
Or with `winget`

```shell
winget install prefix-dev.pixi
```

### Autocompletion

To get autocompletion follow the instructions for your shell.
Afterwards, restart the shell or source the shell config file.

#### Bash (default on most Linux systems)

Add the following to the end of `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
# ~/.bashrc

eval "$(pixi completion --shell bash)"
```
#### Zsh (default on macOS)

Add the following to the end of `~/.zshrc`:


```zsh
# ~/.zshrc

eval "$(pixi completion --shell zsh)"
```

#### PowerShell (pre-installed on all Windows systems)

Add the following to the end of `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`.
You can check the location of this file by querying the `$PROFILE` variable in PowerShell.
Typically the path is `~\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` or
`~/.config/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` on -Nix.

```pwsh
(& pixi completion --shell powershell) | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

#### Fish

Add the following to the end of `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```fish
# ~/.config/fish/config.fish

pixi completion --shell fish | source
```

#### Nushell

Add the following to your Nushell config file (find it by running `$nu.config-path` in Nushell):

```nushell
mkdir $"($nu.data-dir)/vendor/autoload"
pixi completion --shell nushell | save --force $"($nu.data-dir)/vendor/autoload/pixi-completions.nu"
```

#### Elvish

Add the following to the end of `~/.elvish/rc.elv`:

```elv
# ~/.elvish/rc.elv

eval (pixi completion --shell elvish | slurp)
```

### Distro Packages

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/pixi.svg)](https://repology.org/project/pixi/versions)

#### Arch Linux

You can install `pixi` from the [extra repository](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/pixi/) using [pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman):

```shell
pacman -S pixi
```

#### Alpine Linux

`pixi` is available for [Alpine Edge](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=pixi&branch=edge). It can be installed via [apk](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Package_Keeper) after enabling the [testing repository](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Repositories).

```shell
apk add pixi
```

## Build/install from source

`pixi` is 100% written in Rust and therefore it can be installed, built and tested with cargo.
To start using `pixi` from a source build run:

```shell
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi.git pixi
```

We don't publish to `crates.io` anymore, so you need to install it from the repository.
The reason for this is that we depend on some unpublished crates which disallows us to publish to `crates.io`.

or when you want to make changes use:

```shell
cargo build
cargo test
```

If you have any issues building because of the dependency on `rattler` checkout
it's [compile steps](https://github.com/conda/rattler/tree/main#give-it-a-try)

## Uninstall

To uninstall, the Pixi binary should be removed.
Delete `pixi` from the `$PIXI_DIR` which is default to `~/.pixi/bin/pixi`

So on Linux its:

```shell
rm ~/.pixi/bin/pixi
```

and on Windows:

```shell
$PIXI_BIN = "$Env:LocalAppData\pixi\bin\pixi"; Remove-Item -Path $PIXI_BIN
```

After this command you can still use the tools you installed with `pixi`.
To remove these as well just remove the whole `~/.pixi` directory and remove the directory from your path.

# Usage

The cli looks as follows:

```bash
‚ûú pixi

```bash
pixi run cowpy "Thanks for using pixi"
```

Activate a shell in the environment

```shell
pixi shell
cowpy "Thanks for using pixi"
exit
```

## Installing a conda package globally

You can also globally install conda packages into their own environment.
This behavior is similar to [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) or [`condax`](https://github.com/mariusvniekerk/condax).

```bash
pixi global install cowpy
```

## Use in GitHub Actions

You can use Pixi in GitHub Actions to install dependencies and run commands.
It supports automatic caching of your environments.

```yml
- uses: prefix-dev/setup-pixi@v0.8.1
- run: pixi exec cowpy "Thanks for using pixi"
```

See the [documentation](https://pixi.sh/latest/advanced/github_actions) for more details.
