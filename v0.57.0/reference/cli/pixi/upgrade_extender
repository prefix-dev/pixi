!!! note
    The `pixi upgrade` command will update only `version`s, except when you specify the exact package name (`pixi upgrade numpy`).

    Then it will remove all fields, apart from:

    - `build` field containing a wildcard `*`
    - `channel`
    - `file_name`
    - `url`
    - `subdir`.

!!! note
    In v0.55.0 and earlier releases, by default only the `default` feature was upgraded.
    Pass `--feature=default` if you want to emulate this behaviour on newer releases.
