Pixi is a package management tool for developers.
It allows the developer to install libraries and applications in a reproducible way.
Use pixi cross-platform, on Windows, Mac and Linux.

# Installation

To install `pixi` you can run the following command in your terminal:

<Tabs groupId="install_os">
    <TabItem value="Linux & macOS">
        ```bash
        curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
        ```

        The above invocation will automatically download the latest version of `pixi`, extract it, and move the `pixi` binary to `~/.pixi/bin`.
        If this directory does not already exist, the script will create it.

        The script will also update your `~/.bash_profile` to include `~/.pixi/bin` in your PATH, allowing you to invoke the `pixi` command from anywhere.

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Windows">
        ```shell
        iwr -useb https://pixi.sh/install.ps1 | iex
        ```

        The above invocation will automatically download the latest version of `pixi`, extract it, and move the `pixi` binary to `LocalAppData/pixi/bin`.
        If this directory does not already exist, the script will create it.

        The command will also automatically add `LocalAppData/pixi/bin` to your path allowing you to invoke `pixi` from anywhere.

You might need to restart your terminal or source your shell for the changes to take effect.

# Autocompletion

To get autocompletion run:

<Tabs groupId="install_os">
    <TabItem value="Linux & macOS">
        ```shell
        # Pick your shell (use `echo $SHELL` to find the shell you are using.):
        echo 'eval "$(pixi completion --shell bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
        echo 'eval "$(pixi completion --shell zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
        echo 'pixi completion --shell fish | source' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
        echo 'eval (pixi completion --shell elvish | slurp)' >> ~/.elvish/rc.elv
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Windows">
        ```powershell
        Add-Content -Path $PROFILE -Value '(& pixi completion --shell powershell) | Out-String | Invoke-Expression'
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

And then restart the shell or source the shell config file.

## Alternative installation methods

Although we recommend installing pixi through the above method we also provide additional installation methods.

### Homebrew

Pixi is available via homebrew. To install pixi via homebrew simply run:

```shell
brew install pixi
```

### Windows installer

We provide an `msi` installer on [our Github releases page](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/releases/latest).
The installer will download pixi and add it to the path.

### Install from source

pixi is 100% written in Rust, and therefore it can be installed, build and tested with cargo.
To start using pixi from a source build run:

```shell
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi.git
```

or when you want to make changes use:

```shell
cargo build
cargo test
```

If you have any issues building because of the dependency on `rattler` checkout
it's [compile steps](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler/tree/main#give-it-a-try)

## Uninstall

To uninstall pixi from your system, simply remove the binary.

<Tabs groupId="install_os">
    <TabItem value="Linux & macOS">
        ```shell
        rm ~/.pixi/bin/pixi
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Windows">
        ```shell
        $PIXI_BIN = "$Env:LocalAppData\pixi\bin\pixi"; Remove-Item -Path $PIXI_BIN
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After this command, you can still use the tools you installed with pixi.
To remove these as well, just remove the whole `~/.pixi` directory and remove the directory from your path.
