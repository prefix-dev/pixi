??? note "Installing direnv"

    Of course you can use `pixi` to install `direnv` globally. We recommend to run

    ```bash
    pixi global install direnv
    ```

    to install the latest version of `direnv` on your computer.

You can use `pixi` in combination with `direnv` to automatically activate environments on entering the corresponding directory.
Enter the following into your `.envrc` file:

```shell title=".envrc"
watch_file pixi.lock # (1)!
eval "$(pixi shell-hook)" # (2)!
```

1. This ensures that every time your `pixi.lock` changes, `direnv` invokes the shell-hook again.
2. This installs if needed, and activates the environment. `direnv` ensures that the environment is deactivated when you leave the directory.

```shell
$ cd my-project
direnv: error /my-project/.envrc is blocked. Run `direnv allow` to approve its content
$ direnv allow
direnv: loading /my-project/.envrc
âœ” Project in /my-project is ready to use!

$ which python
