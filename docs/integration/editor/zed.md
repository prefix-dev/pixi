[Zed](https://zed.dev/) is a relatively new development environment.

To use `pixi` inside of Zed, follow these steps:

* Create a `pixi.toml` file.

See [`direnv`](../third_party/direnv.md).
* Install `direnv`.
* Add an `.envrc` to the project.

[Zed has native support for direnv](https://zed.dev/docs/configuring-zed#direnv-integration).
