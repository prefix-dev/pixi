[^1]:
    An **up-to-date** lock file means that the dependencies in the lock file are allowed by the dependencies in the manifest file.
    For example

    - a manifest with `python = ">= 3.11"` is up-to-date with a `name: python, version: 3.11.0` in the `pixi.lock`.
    - a manifest with `python = ">= 3.12"` is **not** up-to-date with a `name: python, version: 3.11.0` in the `pixi.lock`.

    Being up-to-date does **not** mean that the lock file holds the latest version available on the channel for the given dependency.
