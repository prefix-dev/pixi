All commands in this section are used to manage global installations of packages and environments through the global manifest.
More info on the global manifest can be found [here](../../../global_tools/introduction.md).

!!! tip
    Binaries and environments installed globally are stored in `~/.pixi`
    by default, this can be changed by setting the `PIXI_HOME` environment
    variable.
