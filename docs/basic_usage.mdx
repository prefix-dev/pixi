Make sure that you have `pixi` installed, this should print the help function, check the [installation manual](overview) if it doesn't.

```shell
pixi
```

Initialize a new project and navigate to the project directory.

```shell
pixi init pixi-hello-world
cd pixi-hello-world
```

Add the dependencies you would like to use.

```shell
pixi add python
```

Create a file named `hello_world.py` in the directory and paste the following code into the file.

```python title="hello_world.py" showLineNumbers
def hello():
    print("Hello World, to the new revolution in package management.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello()
```

Run the code inside the environment.

```shell
pixi run python hello_world.py
```

You can also put this run command in a **task**.

```shell
pixi task add hello python hello_world.py
```

After adding the task, you can run the task using its name.

```shell
pixi run hello
```

Use the `shell` command to activate the environment and start a new shell in there.

```shell
pixi shell
python
exit
```

You've just learned the basic features of pixi:
1. adding a dependency.
2. adding a task, and executing it.
3. running a program.
Feel free to play around with what you just learned like adding more tasks, dependencies or code.
