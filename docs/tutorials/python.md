# Tutorial: Doing python development with pixi

In this tutorial we will show you how to create a simple python project with pixi. We will show some of the features that pixi provides, that are currently
not a part of `pdm`, `poetry` etc.

## Why is this useful?
Pixi builts upon on the conda ecosystem, which allows you to create a python environment with all the dependencies you need. This is especially useful when you are working with multiple python interpreters and bindings to C and C++ libraries. Let's give it a go! E.g GDAL from PyPI does not have the binary C dependencies, but the conda package does.

## pixi.toml and pyproject.toml
We support two manifests formats, `pyproject.toml` and `pixi.toml`. In this tutorial we will use the `pyproject.toml` format. Because it is the most common format for python projects.

## Let's get started

Lets start out by making a directory and creating a new `pyproject.toml` file.

```shell
pixi init pixi_py --pyproject
```

This gives you the following pyproject.toml:

```toml
[project]
name = "pixi_py"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add a short description here"
authors = [{name = "Tim de Jager", email = "tim@prefix.dev"}]
requires-python = ">= 3.11"
dependencies = []

[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[tool.pixi.project]
channels = ["conda-forge"]
platforms = ["osx-arm64"]

[tool.pixi.pypi-dependencies]
pixi_py = { path = ".", editable = true }

[tool.pixi.tasks]
```

Let's add the python project to the tree:

=== "Linux & macOS"
    ```shell
    cd pixi_py # move into the project directory
    mkdir pixi_py
    touch pixi_py/__init__.py
    ```

=== "Windows"
    ```shell
    cd pixi_py
    mkdir pixi_py
    type nul > pixi_py\__init__.py
    ```

We now have the following directory structure:

```shell
.
â”œâ”€â”€ pixi_py
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â””â”€â”€ pyproject.toml
```

We've used a flat-layout here but we support both [flat- and src-layouts](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/src-layout-vs-flat-layout/#src-layout-vs-flat-layout).

### What's in the pyproject?

Okay, so let's have a look at what's sections have been added.

These things were added to the pyproject.toml file:

```toml
# 1. Main pixi entry
[tool.pixi.project]
channels = ["conda-forge"]
# This is your machine platform by default
platforms = ["osx-arm64"]

# 2. Editable installs
[tool.pixi.pypi-dependencies]
pixi_py = { path = ".", editable = true }
```

Let's go over them one by one:

1. The `channels` and `platforms` are added to the `[tool.pixi.project]` section. Channels like `conda-forge` manage packages similar to pypi but allow for different packages across languages. Platforms determines for what platform to generate the lock for.
2. The `pixi_py` package is added as an editable dependency. This means that the package is installed in editable mode, so you can make changes to the package and see the changes reflected in the environment. In pixi, unlike other package managers this is explicitly stated in the `pyproject.toml` file. The main reason being so that you can choose into which environment this package should be included.

Now let's add some optional dependencies:

```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
test = ["pytest"]

# 3. Environments
[tool.pixi.environments]
default = { solve-group = "default" }
test = { features = ["test"], solve-group = "default" }
```

We've added the optional dependencies to the `pyproject.toml` and this automatically creates a [`feature`](../reference/configuration.md/#the-feature-and-environments-tables), which is a collection of `dependencies`, `tasks`, `channels` etc.
These features can be combined

3. We've created the `default` and `test` environments. The `default` environment is the default environment that is created when you run `pixi install`. The `test` environment is created from the optional dependencies in the `pyproject.toml` file. You can execute commands in this environment with e.g `pixi run -e test python`

??? note "Solve Groups"
    Solve groups are a way to group dependencies together. This is useful when you have multiple environments that share the same dependencies. This way you can solve dependencies together. E.g maybe `pytest` is a dependency that influences the dependencies of the `default` environment. By putting these in the same solve group, you assure that the versions in `test` and `default` are exactly the same versions.


### Installation: `pixi install`

Now let's `install` the project with `pixi install`:

```shell
$ pixi install
âœ” Project in /private/tmp/pixi_py is ready to use!
```

We now have a new directory called `.pixi` in the project root. This directory contains the environment that was created when we ran `pixi install`. The environment is a conda environment that contains the dependencies that we specified in the `pyproject.toml` file. We can also install the test environment with `pixi install -e test`. We can use these environments for executing code.

We also have a new file called `pixi.lock` in the project root. This file contains the exact versions of the dependencies that were installed in the environment, across platforms.

## What's in the environment?

!!! Python interpreters
    The python interpreter is also installed in the environment. This is because the python interpreter version is read from the `requires-python` field in the `pyproject.toml` file. This is used to determine the python version to install in the environment. This way pixi automatically manages/bootstraps the python interpreter for you, so no more `brew`, `apt` or other system install steps.

Using `pixi list` you can see what's in the environment, this is essentially a nicer view on the lock file:

```shell
$ pixi list
Package          Version       Build               Size       Kind   Source
bzip2            1.0.8         h93a5062_5          119.5 KiB  conda  bzip2-1.0.8-h93a5062_5.conda

pixi_py          0.1.0                                        pypi   . (editable)
xz               5.2.6         h57fd34a_0          230.2 KiB  conda  xz-5.2.6-h57fd34a_0.tar.bz2
```

Here you can see the different conda and pypi packages listed. And as you can see the `pixi_py` package, that we are working on, is installed in editable mode. Every environment in pixi is isolated, but re-uses files that are hard-linked from a central cache directory. This means that you can have multiple environments with the same packages, but only have the individual files stored once on disk.

## Getting code to run

Lets add some code to the `pixi_py` package. We will add a new function to the `pixi_py/__init__.py` file:

```python
from rich import print

def hello():
    return "Hello, [bold magenta]World[/bold magenta]!", ":vampire:"

def say_hello():
    print(*hello())
```
Now add the `rich` dependency using: `pixi add --pypi rich`.

Let's see if it this works by running:

```shell
pixi r python -c "import pixi_py; pixi_py.say_hello()"
Hello, World! ðŸ§›
```
??? note "Slow?"
	The first time this might be slow because we install the project but the second time it will be instant.

So we are running a python interpreter installed from conda. And we are importing the `pixi_py` package that is installed in editable mode. And we are calling the `say_hello` function that we just added. And it works! Cool!

## Testing this code

Okay, so let's add a test for this function. Let's add a `tests/test_me.py` file in root of the project.

Giving us the following project structure:

```shell
.
â”œâ”€â”€ pixi.lock
â”œâ”€â”€ pixi_py
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml
â””â”€â”€ tests/test_me.py
```

```python
from pixi_py import hello

def test_pixi_py():
    assert hello() == ("Hello, [bold magenta]World[/bold magenta]!", ":vampire:")
```

Let's add an easy task for running the tests.

```shell
$ pixi task add --feature test test "pytest"
âœ” Added task `test`: pytest .
```

So pixi has a task system to make it easy to run commands. Similar to `npm` scripts or something you would specify in a `Justfile`.

??? tip "Pixi tasks"
    Tasks are actually a pretty cool pixi feature that are powerful and are run in a cross-platform shell. You can do caching, dependencies and more. Read more about tasks in the [tasks](../features/advanced_tasks.md) section.

```shell
$ pixi r test
âœ¨ Pixi task (test): pytest .
================================================================================================= test session starts =================================================================================================
platform darwin -- Python 3.12.2, pytest-8.1.1, pluggy-1.4.0
rootdir: /private/tmp/pixi_py

test_me.py .                                                                                                                                                                                                    [100%]

================================================================================================== 1 passed in 0.00s =================================================================================================
```

Cool it seems to be working!

### Test vs Default environment
Interesting thing is if we compare the output of
the two environments.

```shell
pixi list -e test
# v.s. default environment
pixi list
```

Is that the test environment has:

```shell
package          version       build               size       kind   source
...
pytest           8.1.1                             1.1 mib    pypi   pytest-8.1.1-py3-none-any.whl
...
```

But the default environment is missing this package.
This way you can finetune your environments to only have the packages that are needed for that environment.
E.g you could also have a `dev` environment that has `pytest` and `ruff` installed, but you could omit these from the `prod` environment.
There is a [docker](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/tree/main/examples/docker) example that shows how to set-up a minimal `prod` environment, and copy from there.

## Replacing pypi packages with conda packages
Last thing, pixi provides the ability for `pypi` packages to depend on `conda` packages.
Let's add `pygments` to the `pyproject.toml` file. Which is a dependency of the `rich` package.

```shell
pixi add pygments
```
This will add the following to the `pyproject.toml` file:

```toml
[tool.pixi.dependencies]
pygments = ">=2.17.2,<2.18"
```

We can now see that the `pygments` package is now installed as conda package.

```shell
$ pixi list
Package          Version       Build               Size       Kind   Source
...
pygments         2.17.2        pyhd8ed1ab_0        840.3 KiB  conda  pygments-2.17.2-pyhd8ed1ab_0.conda
```

This way PyPI dependencies and conda dependencies can be mixed and matched, and seamlessly interoperate.

```shell
$  pixi r python -c "import pixi_py; pixi_py.say_hello()"
Hello, World! ðŸ§›
```

And it still works!

## Conclusion

In this tutorial you've seen how easy it is to use a `pyproject.toml` to manage your pixi dependencies. As well, as how to use PyPI and conda dependencies together in the same project.

Hopefully, this provides for flexible and powerful way to manage your python projects, and a fertile base for further exploration with pixi.
