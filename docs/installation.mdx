To install pixi you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prefix-dev/pixi/main/install/install.sh | bash
```

Or on windows

```shell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prefix-dev/pixi/main/install/install.ps1 | iex
```

The above invocation will automatically download the latest version of `pixi`, extract it, and move the `pixi` binary to `~/.pixi/bin` (or `LocalAppData/pixi/bin` on Windows).
If this directory does not already exist, the script will create it.

On unix based platforms (linux and macOS) it will also update your ~/.bash_profile to include ~/.pixi/bin in your PATH, allowing you to invoke the pixi command from anywhere.

On Windows `LocalAppData/pixi/bin` is automatically added to the path.

> **Note**: You might need to restart your terminal or source your shell for the changes to take effect.

## Alternative installation methods

Although we recommend installing pixi through the above method we also provide additional installation methods.

### Homebrew

Pixi is available via homebrew. To install pixi via homebrew simply run:

```shell
brew install pixi
```

### Windows installer

We provide an `msi` installer on [our Github releases page](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/releases/latest).
The installer will download pixi and add it to the path.

### Install from source

pixi is 100% written in Rust and therefore it can be installed, build and
tested with cargo.
To start using pixi from a source build run:

```shell
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi.git
```

or when you want to make changes use:

```shell
cargo build
cargo test
```

If you have any issues building because of the dependency on `rattler` checkout
it's [compile steps](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler/tree/main#give-it-a-try)

## Uninstall

To uninstall the pixi binary should be removed.
Delete pixi from the `$PIXI_DIR` which is default to `~/.pixi/bin/pixi`

So on linux its:

```shell
rm ~/.pixi/bin/pixi
```

and on windows:

```shell
$PIXI_BIN = "$Env:LocalAppData\pixi\bin\pixi"; Remove-Item -Path $PIXI_BIN
```

After this command you can still use the tools you installed with pixi.
To remove these as well just remove the whole `~/.pixi` directory and remove the directory from your path.

## Autocompletion

To get autocompletion run:

```shell
# On unix (MacOS or Linux), pick your shell (use `echo $SHELL` to find the shell you are using.):
echo 'eval "$(pixi completion --shell bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(pixi completion --shell zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'pixi completion --shell fish | source' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
echo 'eval (pixi completion --shell elvish | slurp)' >> ~/.elvish/rc.elv
```

For PowerShell on Windows:

```pwsh
Add-Content -Path $PROFILE -Value '(& pixi completion --shell powershell) | Out-String | Invoke-Expression'
```

And then restart the shell or source the shell config file.
