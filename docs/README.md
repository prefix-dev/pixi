# pixi: Package management made easy

`pixi` is a cross-platform, multi-language package manager and workflow tool
build on the shoulders of the conda ecosystem.

`pixi` provides all developers the exceptional experience that is usually found
with package managers like `cargo` or `yarn` but for any language.

https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/assets/885054/64666dee-841d-4680-9a61-7927913bc4e2

## Highlights

- Support for **multiple languages** like Python, C++ and R using Conda packages
- **All OS's**: Linux, Windows, macOS (including Apple Silicon)
- A **lockfile** is always included and always up-to-date.
- A clean and simple Cargo-like **command-line interface**.
- Install tools **per-project** or **system-wide**.
- Completely written in **Rust** and build on top of the **[rattler](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler)** library.

## Getting Started

* ‚ö° [Installation](#installation)
* ‚öôÔ∏è [Examples](../examples)
* üìö [Documentation](./getting_started.md)
* üòç [Contributing](#contributing)

# Status

This project is currently in _alpha stage_.
There are many features that we want to add.
The file formats are still in flux.
Expect breaking changes while we work towards a v1.0.

Some notable features that we have in the pipeline are:

* **Build and publish** your project as a Conda package.
* Support for **PyPi packages**.
* Support **dependencies from source**.
* Improve docs, examples and user experience

# Installation
You can install `pixi` as a binary from the releases.
`pixi` can be installed on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
The provided scripts will automatically download the latest version of `pixi`, extract it, and move the `pixi` binary to `~/.pixi/bin`.
If this directory does not already exist, the script will create it.

## macOS and Linux
To install Pixi on macOS and Linux, open a terminal and run the following command:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prefix-dev/pixi/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```
The script will also update your ~/.bash_profile to include ~/.pixi/bin in your PATH, allowing you to invoke the pixi command from anywhere.
You might need to restart your terminal or source your shell for the changes to take effect.

## Windows
To install Pixi on Windows, open a PowerShell terminal (you may need to run it as an administrator) and run the following command:

```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prefix-dev/pixi/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```
The script will inform you once the installation is successful and add the ~/.pixi/bin directory to your PATH, which will allow you to run the pixi command from any location.

## Install from source

`pixi` is 100% written in Rust and therefor it can be installed, build and
tested with cargo.
To start using `pixi` from a source build run:

```shell
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi.git
```

or when you want to make changes use:

```shell
cargo build
cargo test
```

If you have any issues building because of the dependency on `rattler` checkout
it's [compile steps](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler/tree/main#give-it-a-try)

## Uninstall
To uninstall the pixi binary should be removed.
Delete `pixi` from the `$PIXI_DIR` which is default to `~/.pixi/bin/pixi`

So on linux its:
```shell
rm ~/.pixi/bin/pixi
```
and on windows:
```shell
$PIXI_BIN = "$Env:LocalAppData\pixi\bin\pixi"; Remove-Item -Path $PIXI_BIN
```
After this command you can still use the tools you installed with `pixi`.
To remove these as well just remove the whole `~/.pixi` directory and remove the directory from your path.

### Autocompletion

To get autocompletion run:

```shell
# On unix (MacOS or Linux), pick your shell (use `echo $SHELL` to find the shell you are using.):
echo 'eval "$(pixi completion --shell bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(pixi completion --shell zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'pixi completion --shell fish | source' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
echo 'eval (pixi completion --shell elvish | slurp)' >> ~/.elvish/rc.elv

# On Windows:
Add-Content -Path $PROFILE -Value 'Invoke-Expression (&pixi completion --shell powershell)'
```

And then restart the shell or source the shell config file.

# Usage

The cli looks as follows:

```bash
‚ûú pixi -h
A package management and workflow tool

Usage: pixi [COMMAND]

Commands:
  completion  Generates a completion script for a shell
  init        Creates a new project
  add         Adds a dependency to the project
  run         Runs command in project
  install     Installs the defined package in a global accessible location
  help        Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```

## Creating a pixi project

Initialize a new project and navigate to the project directory

```
pixi init myproject && cd myproject
```

Add the dependencies you want to use

```
pixi add cowpy
```

Run the installed package in its environment

```bash
pixi run cowpy "Thanks for using pixi"
```

For more information check [the documentation](getting_started.md#basics-of-the-configuration-file)

## Installing a conda package globally

You can also globally install conda packages into their own environment.
This behavior is similar to [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx).

```bash
pixi install cowpy
```

For more examples
check [the documentation](./examples.md#global-package-installation-in-isolation)
