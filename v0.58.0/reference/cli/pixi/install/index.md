## Description

Install an environment, both updating the lockfile and installing the environment.

This command installs an environment, if the lockfile is not up-to-date it will be updated.

`pixi install` only installs one environment at a time, if you have multiple environments you can select the right one with the `--environment` flag. If you don't provide an environment, the `default` environment will be installed.

If you want to install all environments, you can use the `--all` flag.

Running `pixi install` is not required before running other commands like `pixi run` or `pixi shell`. These commands will automatically install the environment if it is not already installed.

You can use `pixi reinstall` to reinstall all environments, one environment or just some packages of an environment.

## Examples

```shell
pixi install  # (1)!
pixi install --manifest-path ~/myworkspace/pixi.toml # (2)!
pixi install --frozen # (3)!
pixi install --locked # (4)!
pixi install --environment lint # (5)!
pixi install -e lint # (5)!

```
