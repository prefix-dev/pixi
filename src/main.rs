    // Non-main threads should all have 2MB, as Rust forces platform consistency.
    // The default can be overridden with the RUST_MIN_STACK environment variable if
    // you need more.
    //
    // However, the real issue is the main thread. There is a large variety here
    // across platforms and it's harder to control (which is why Rust doesn't
    // normalize is by default). Notably on macOS and Linux you will typically get
    // 8MB for the main thread, while on Windows we only get 1MB, which is tiny in
    // comparison:
    // https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/stack-stack-allocations?view=msvc-170
    //
    // To normalize this we spawn an additional thread called `main2` with a size we
    // can set ourselves. 2MB tends to be too small (especially for debug builds).
    // 4MB seems fine. The code also tries to respect RUST_MIN_STACK if it is set,
    // which allows overriding the defaults. We don't allow stack sizes smaller than
    // 4MB to avoid misconfiguration since we know we use quite a bit of stack
    // space.
